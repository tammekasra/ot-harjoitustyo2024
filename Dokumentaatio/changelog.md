## Week 3

-- Main.py and and only one test was added.
-- Sadly for some reason the __pycache__ still pop up despite having the "correct" things in .gitignore
-- The first official board has been done for the sudoku game


## Week 4

-- I got generating a correct board for sudoku that prints a board where there are no same numbers in the same row, column and 3x3 grid
-- There are new tests that checks if the board indeed is correct!
