## Week 3

-- Main.py and and only one test was added.
-- Sadly for some reason the __pycache__ still pop up despite having the "correct" things in .gitignore
-- The first official board has been done for the sudoku game


## Week 4

-- I got generating a correct board for sudoku that prints a board where there are no same numbers in the same row, column and 3x3 grid
-- There are new tests that checks if the board indeed is correct!

## Week 5

-- The UI got implemented, but it still doesn't properly function well, it tends to crash multiple times....

## Week 6

-- The sudoku game itself now works and also has additional pointing system that gives you or takes a away points for either correct solution or cheating.

-- The U.I has been implemented to ask user for name and difficulty, I sadly made the code a bit too difficult for myself to implement further such that whenever the
game stop, it display the name of the players and points.

-- I just added one more test that checks whether the sudoku puzzle itself is solvable or not (extra testing)
